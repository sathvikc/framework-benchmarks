### Intro
I've built the same weather app in 16 different frontend web frameworks.
Along with automated scripts to benchmark each of their performance, quality and capabilities.
To finally answer the age-old question: "Which is the _best_* frontend framework?"<br>
So, without further ado, let's see how every framework weathers the storm! ⛈️

#### Why?
1. To objectively compare frontend frameworks in an automated way
2. Because I have no life, and like building the same thing 10 times

#### What does _best_ mean?
- Smallest bundle size and best compression
- Fastest load time _(FCP, LCP, TTI, TTFB, etc)_
- Lowest resource consumption _(CPU & memory usage, etc)_
- Most maintainable _(least verbose, complex and repetitive code)_
- Quickest build time _(prod compile, dev server HMR latency, etc)_

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You'll need to ensure you've got Git, Node (v22+) and Python (3.10+) installed

### Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lissy93/framework-benchmarks.git
cd framework-benchmarks
npm install
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
npm run setup
```

### Developing
Run `npm run dev:[app-name]`<br>
Or, you can: `cd ./apps/[app-name]` then `npm i` and `npm run dev`

### Testing
All apps are tested with the same shared test suite, to ensure they all conform to the same requirements, and are fully functional.
Tests are dome with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) and can be found in the [`tests/`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/main/tests) directory.

Either execute tests for all implementations with `npm test`, or just for a specific app with `npm run test:[app]` (e.g. `npm run test:react`).<br>
You should also verify the lint checks pass, with `npm run lint` or `npm run lint:[app]`.

### Deploying
Build the app for production, with `npm run build:[app-name]`<br>
Then upload the app's build output (`dist/`, `build/` or the app root, depending on the framework) to any web server, CDN or static hosting provider


### Adding a Framework
1. Create app directory: `apps/[app-name]/` with `package.json`, a build config (e.g. `vite.config.js`), and a `src/` dir
2. Register the framework in [`frameworks.json`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/frameworks.json)
3. Run `npm run setup` to generate the npm scripts and test config, sync shared assets and mocks, and install deps. Verify with `npm run check`
4. Code your app!<br>
  4.1. Preview locally with `npm run dev:[app-name]`<br>
  4.2. then test with `npm run test:[app-name]` to ensure it meets the [requirements spec](#requirement-spec)
5. Validate everything passes with the test, lint and build scripts

## Project Outline

### Directory Structure

```
framework-benchmarks
├── scripts					# Scripts for managing the app (syncing assets, generating mocks, etc)
├── assets					# These are shared across all apps for consistency
│   ├── icons				# SVG icons, used by all apps
│   ├── styles			# CSS classes and variables, used by all apps
│   └── mocks				# Mocked data, used by apps when running benchmarks
├── website					# Source templates for the results website
├── tests						# Test suit
└── apps						# Directory for each app as a standalone project
    ├── react/
    ├── svelte/
    ├── angular/
    └── ...
```

### Scripts
The **[`scripts/`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/main/scripts)** directory contains
everything for managing the project (setup, testing, benchmarking, reporting, etc).
You can view a list of scripts by running `npm run help`.

### Shared Assets
To keep things uniform, all apps will share certain assets

- **[`tests/`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/main/tests)** - Same test suit used for all apps. To ensure each app conforms to the spec and is fully functional
- **[`assets/`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/main/assets)** - Same static assets (icons, fonts, styles, meta, etc)
- **[`assets/styles/`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/tree/main/assets/styles)** - Same styles for all apps, and theming is done with CSS variables

### Third Parties
- **Dependencies**: Beyond their framework code, none of the apps use any additional dependencies, libraries or third-party "stuff"
- **Data**: Apps support using real weather data, from [open-meteo api](https://open-meteo.com). However, to keep tests fair, we use mocked data when running benchmarks.

### Commands

- `npm run setup` - Creates mock data, syncs assets, updates scripts and installs dependencies
- `npm run test` - Runs the test suite for all apps, or a specific app
- `npm run lint` - Runs the linter for all apps, or a specific app
- `npm run check` - Verifies the project is correctly setup and ready to go
- `npm run build` - Builds all apps, or a specific app for production
- `npm run start` - Starts the demo server, which serves up all built apps
- `npm run help` - Displays a list of all available commands

See the [`package.json`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/package.json) for all commands, and `npm run help` for details.

Note that the project commands get generated automatically by the [`generate_scripts.py`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/scripts/setup/generate_scripts.py) script, based on the contents of [`frameworks.json`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/frameworks.json) and [`config.json`](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/config.json). That's what `npm run setup` is for.

## Requirement Spec

Every app is built with identical requirements (as validated by the shared test suite), and uses the same assets, styles, and data. The only difference is the framework used to build each.

### Technical Requirements
Why a weather app? Because it enables us to use all the critical features of any frontend framework, including:
- Binding user input and validation
- Fetching external data asynchronously
- Basic state management of components
- Handling fallback views (loading, errors)
- Using browser features (location, storage, etc)
- Logic blocks, for iterative content and conditionals
- Lifecycle methods (mounting, updating, unmounting)

### Functional Requirements
For our app to be somewhat complete and useful, it must do the following:
- On initial load, the user should see weather for their current GPS location
- The user should be able to search for a city, and view it's weather
- And the user's city should be stored in localstorage for next time
- The app should show a detailed view of the current weather
- And a summary 7-day forecast, where days can be expanded for more details

### Quality Requirements
There's certain standards every app should follow, and we want to use best practices, so:
- Theming: The app should support both light and dark mode, based on the user's preferences
- Internationalization: The copy should be extracted out of the code, so that it is translatable
- Accessibility: The app should meet AA standard of WCAG in line with the EAA
- Mobile: The app should be fully responsive and optimized for mobile
- Performance: The app should be efficiently coded as best as the framework allows
- Testing: Core functionality, logic and complexity should be tested, aiming for 90% coverage
- Error Handling: App should be robust, with errors handled gracefully and correctly surfaced
- Quality: The code should be clean, typechecked, linted and formatted consistently
- Security: Code should follow secure best practices, inline with OWASP reccomentations
- SEO: Correct semantic elements, meta and og tags and SSR compatible where applicable
- CI: Automated tests, lints and validation should ensure all changes are compliant

### Benchmarking Requirements
To compare the frameworks, we need to measure:
- Bundle size & output
- Load metrics: FCP, LCP, CLS, TTI, interaction latency
- Hydration/SSR cost, CPU & memory
- Cold vs. warm cache behaviour
- Memory usage: idle, post-flow, leak delta
- Build time & dev server HMR latency

### UI Requirements
The interface is nothing special. It's a simple form which must be identical arcorss all apps, as validated by the snapshots in the tests.<br>
The screenshots will all look like this:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/refs/heads/main/assets/screenshot.png" width="400" />

### Caveats
This is a fair, like-for-like comparison - but it's not the final word. The app uses all the everyday stuff (state, fetching, input, lists, lifecycle), but it won't push any framework to its limits. So worth bearing in mind:
- **Scale**: We're not rendering tens of thousands of nodes, or stress-testing giant lists and rapid re-renders - which is where some frameworks pull ahead
- **Scope**: It's one app archetype. Things like complex routing, deep global state, streaming SSR and heavy animation aren't covered
- **Real-world variance**: Benchmarks run in CI on a single environment, so treat the numbers as a guide, not gospel
