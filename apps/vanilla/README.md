<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/vanilla` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (python3 -m http.server 3000 || python -m http.server 3000)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (echo 'No build step required')
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## Vanilla JavaScript Implementation

<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### ES6 Class Architecture
The [`weather-app.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/vanilla/js/weather-app.js) uses ES6 classes to organize functionality, demonstrating how to structure vanilla JavaScript apps without frameworks.

#### Native DOM APIs
Direct use of `document.querySelector()`, `createElement()`, `addEventListener()` and other native browser APIs. No abstractions - just the platform as designed by browser vendors.

#### Event-Driven Architecture
Manual event handling with `addEventListener()` and custom event patterns. The app manages its own event lifecycle without framework helpers.

#### Explicit State Management
State is manually managed through object properties and explicit DOM updates. When data changes, you must manually call update methods to reflect changes in the UI.

#### Modern JavaScript Features
Leverages async/await, destructuring, template literals, and other ES6+ features to write clean vanilla JavaScript without sacrificing readability.

## About JavaScript
<!-- start_framework_description -->
Vanilla JS just means plain JavaScript, using modern ES6+ features like classes, modules, promises and async/await. 
Most things frameworks used to solve can now be done natively. 
It’s often the best choice for small projects where adding a framework is overkill. 
Plus, it ensures you really understand the language itself.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## My Thoughts on JavaScript
<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
Sometimes the best framework is no framework. Vanilla JavaScript forces you to understand what's actually happening under the hood of all those fancy abstractions. No magic, no build steps, no dependency hell - just the web platform as intended.

For our weather app, vanilla JS is surprisingly capable. `fetch()` handles API calls, `document.querySelector()` finds elements, and `addEventListener()` manages interactions. Modern browser APIs like `localStorage`, `geolocation`, and CSS custom properties give you most of what you need without any external dependencies.

The challenge is organization and state management. Without a framework's structure, you're responsible for everything - keeping the DOM in sync with data, organizing code sensibly, and avoiding spaghetti. Our weather app uses a simple pub/sub pattern and functional organization, but it requires discipline.

The performance is excellent since there's no framework overhead, and the bundle size is minimal. Everything loads fast, and you're not shipping someone else's code to your users. For simple applications or when performance is critical, vanilla JS can be the right choice.

But you'll miss the conveniences of modern frameworks - automatic updates, component organization, and developer experience. What takes one line in React might take ten in vanilla JS. It's a trade-off between control and convenience.

## Real-World App
Since the weather app is very simple, it may be helpful to see a more practical implementation of a Vanilla JavaScript app. So, checkout:
