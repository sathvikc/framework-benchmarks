<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/alpine` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (python3 -m http.server 3000 || python -m http.server 3000)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (echo 'No build step required')
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## Alpine Implementation

<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### HTML-First Approach
Alpine.js enhances HTML directly with directives. The main `index.html` uses `x-data="weatherApp()"` to bind the [`weather-app.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/alpine/js/weather-app.js) function to the DOM.

#### Reactive Data Object
The `weatherApp()` function returns an object with reactive properties (`isLoading`, `hasError`, `currentWeather`) that automatically update the UI when changed.

#### Alpine Directives
Uses Alpine's directive system: `x-show` for conditional visibility, `x-on:click` for event handling, and `x-text` for content binding, making it feel like Vue but with minimal JavaScript.

#### No Build Step Required
Alpine works directly in the browser without compilation. Just include the script tag and start using directives - perfect for progressively enhancing existing HTML.

#### Vanilla JavaScript Integration
The weather logic is written in plain JavaScript functions that return reactive objects, making it easy to understand and debug without framework-specific patterns.

## About Alpine
<!-- start_framework_description -->
Alpine is a super lightweight framework for adding interactivity directly in HTML using attributes. 
It feels like Tailwind but for behaviour, making it ideal for simple UI enhancements without a full build setup. 
Great for quick prototypes or adding sprinkles of interactivity to static sites.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## My Thoughts on Alpine

<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
Alpine.js is like jQuery had a baby with Vue and decided to live directly in your HTML. It's refreshingly simple - you sprinkle a few `x-` attributes into your markup and suddenly you have reactive behavior. No build tools, no bundlers, no complexity. Just add a script tag and start building.

The approach feels intuitive once you get it. `x-data` sets up your reactive state, `x-show` handles conditional rendering, and `x-for` loops through arrays. Our weather app's forecast list is just `<div x-for="day in forecast">` - no components, no imports, no ceremony.

What's clever is how Alpine stays out of your way. The HTML is still readable, the JavaScript is minimal, and everything degrades gracefully if Alpine doesn't load. It's progressive enhancement done right - the page works without JavaScript, but becomes interactive when it loads.

The syntax reads naturally: `x-on:click="searchWeather()"`, `x-text="temperature"`, `x-bind:class="{'active': isExpanded}"`. It's declarative like Vue templates but lives right in the HTML. The reactive updates happen automatically when you modify the data.

For simple interactive websites, Alpine hits the sweet spot. You get modern reactivity without the complexity of a full framework. But for anything complex, you'll miss proper component organization and tooling. Alpine works great for [my whois lookup API](https://github.com/Lissy93/who-dat), because I just needed sprinkles of interactivity to update results, not a full SPA experience.
