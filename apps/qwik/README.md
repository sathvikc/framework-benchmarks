- 🔍 City search functionality
- 📍 Geolocation support
- 💾 Persistent location storage
- 📱 Responsive design
- ♿ Accessible interface
- 🎨 Multi-theme support
- 🧪 Fully unit tested
- 🌐 Internationalized

<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/qwik` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (vite --port 3000)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (vite build)
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## Qwik Implementation
<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### Resumability & Serialization
Qwik's defining feature is resumability - the app can be paused on the server and resumed on the client without re-execution. Functions prefixed with `$` like `$(async (city: string) => {...})` create serialization boundaries.

#### useSignal for State
The [`App.tsx`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/qwik/src/App.tsx) uses `useSignal<WeatherData | null>(null)` for reactive state management, similar to React but optimized for Qwik's lazy execution model.

#### Context API
The [`weatherStore.ts`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/qwik/src/stores/weatherStore.ts) defines a context using `createContextId<WeatherState>('weather')` for sharing state across components without prop drilling.

#### useVisibleTask$ Optimization
Qwik's `useVisibleTask$()` only runs when the component becomes visible, enabling fine-grained lazy loading and reducing initial JavaScript execution.

#### File-based Routing
Uses Qwik City's file-based routing system with `routes/index.tsx` automatically mapping to the root path, similar to Next.js but with Qwik's resumability benefits.

## About Qwik
<!-- start_framework_description -->
Qwik is all about instant load times and fine-grained lazy loading. 
It serialises app state into HTML, letting pages become interactive with almost zero JS upfront. 
It’s built for the modern web where performance and SEO matter. 
It feels experimental but it’s pushing interesting ideas around resumability.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## My Thoughts on Qwik
<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
Qwik is kinda wild. It completely rethinks how web apps work by doing something called "resumability" - your page loads instantly with zero JavaScript, then individual components wake up only when you interact with them. It's like having a webpage that's asleep until you poke it.

The secret is those `$` symbols everywhere. `component$()`, `useTask$()`, `onClick$()` - these aren't just weird syntax, they're lazy loading boundaries. Each `$` tells Qwik "this code can be loaded later when needed." So clicking a button doesn't load the entire app, it just loads that specific button's handler.

For our weather app, this means the initial page render is lightning fast - just HTML and CSS. Search for a city, and only *then* does the search logic get loaded. Click to expand a forecast day, and only the expansion code gets fetched. It's incremental interactivity taken to its logical extreme.

The state management feels familiar but with superpowers. Qwik stores automatically serialize to HTML, so when components resume, they pick up exactly where they left off. No hydration mismatch, no loading spinners, just seamless continuation. For that reason, I used Qwik to build the interactive stuff on my [Digital Defense](https://digital-defense.io/) website.

The trade-off is developer complexity - all those `$` symbols take getting used to, and debugging can be tricky when code loads on-demand. But for performance-critical apps, especially content-heavy sites, Qwik's approach is genuinely revolutionary. Your Core Web Vitals scores will thank you.

## Real-World App
Since the weather app is very simple, it may be helpful to see a more practical implementation of a Qwik app. So, checkout:
