<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/angular` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (ng serve --port 3000)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (ng build)
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## About Angular
<!-- start_framework_description -->
Angular is a full-blown framework from Google, not just a library. 
It comes with everything out of the box, from routing to forms to testing. 
Its TypeScript-first approach and structured architecture make it great for large, enterprise apps. 
The learning curve is steep but it’s incredibly powerful when mastered.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## Angular Implementation
<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### Dependency Injection & Services
The app uses Angular's dependency injection system with services marked as `@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })`. The [`WeatherStateService`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/angular/src/app/services/weather-state.service.ts) manages global state using RxJS `BehaviorSubject`.

#### RxJS Reactive Patterns
State management leverages RxJS observables with operators like `catchError`, `finalize`, `switchMap`, and `delay`. The app component uses `takeUntil` pattern for subscription cleanup to prevent memory leaks.

#### Standalone Components
All components use Angular's modern standalone API, eliminating the need for NgModules. Components import their dependencies directly in the `imports` array.

#### Inline Templates
The [`AppComponent`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/angular/src/app/app.component.ts) demonstrates Angular's inline template syntax with data binding (`[isLoading]`, `(search)`), structural directives, and conditional rendering.

#### TypeScript Integration
Full TypeScript support with typed interfaces for weather data and app state, providing compile-time type checking and better developer experience.

## My Thoughts on Angular
<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
Angular isn't the cool kid anymore, but it's incredibly solid and ships with absolutely everything you need. TypeScript from day one, dependency injection, forms, HTTP client, routing, testing utilities - it's all there, officially maintained and deeply integrated. No need to cobble together a stack from random npm packages.

For our weather app, Angular did kinda feel like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Using the newer standalone components (no more `NgModule` boilerplate!) made things cleaner, but I was still writing a lot more code than I needed in Svelte or Vue. That said, everything does just works, and the TypeScript integration is phenomenal.

The dependency injection system was quite nice for having `WeatherService` automatically injected into components. And RxJS observables handle all the async weather data very nicley, though they do add a learning curve if you're not familiar with reactive programming.

Angular's template syntax with `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `(click)` feels natural once you get used to it. Change detection just works without thinking about it (unlike React where you're constantly memoizing things).

For a simple weather app, we really didn't need any of Angular's big or flagship features (like guards, resolvers, or lazy loading). But I recently build [Domain Locker](https://github.com/lissy93/domain-locker) using Angular, and it was a great fit for the complexity of that project, As the structure, type safety, and tooling made it easy to manage a large codebase with multiple features.
