<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/vanjs` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (vite --port 3000)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (vite build)
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## VanJS Implementation
<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### Hyperscript DOM Creation
The [`main.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/vanjs/src/main.js) uses VanJS's hyperscript syntax with `const { div, h1, p } = van.tags` to create DOM elements functionally without JSX or templates.

#### Reactive State with van.state
VanJS provides reactive state through `van.state('initial')` which returns an object with a `.val` property. Changes to `state.val` automatically trigger re-renders of dependent DOM.

#### Functional Component Pattern
Components are plain JavaScript functions that return DOM elements. The `WeatherApp` class demonstrates organizing complex UI logic while maintaining VanJS's functional approach.

#### Direct DOM Manipulation
Unlike virtual DOM frameworks, VanJS directly manipulates the real DOM, making it extremely lightweight (~1KB) while maintaining reactivity through state bindings.

#### Template-less Architecture
No templates, JSX, or HTML strings - everything is created through JavaScript functions, providing full IDE support and type safety for DOM creation.

## About Van
<!-- start_framework_description -->
VanJS is an ultra-tiny library for writing reactive UIs with plain functions. 
No build step, no virtual DOM, just direct DOM manipulation with reactivity built in. 
It’s surprisingly powerful for its size and is good for small apps or embedded widgets. 
Think of it as a modern alternative to jQuery that actually plays nice with modern JS.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## My Thoughts on Van
<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
VanJS is impressively tiny - just 1KB of runtime with zero dependencies. It's basically "what if we took the reactive parts of modern frameworks and stripped away everything else?" The result is surprisingly elegant for simple applications, but you'll quickly bump into its limitations.

The functional approach is refreshing after dealing with classes and complex component lifecycles. `van.state(initialValue)` creates reactive state, `van.tags.div()` creates DOM elements, and everything just works. Our weather app's temperature display is literally `van.tags.span(temperature)` - when `temperature` changes, the DOM updates automatically.

But the simplicity comes with trade-offs. There's no component abstraction beyond functions, no templating system, no event system. You're essentially building a reactive version of vanilla DOM manipulation. It works for basic interactivity but gets unwieldy fast.

The DOM creation syntax is functional but verbose: `van.tags.div({class: "weather-card"}, van.tags.h2("Weather"))`. Coming from JSX or template languages, it feels like writing assembly code. You'll miss the declarative nature of modern frameworks.

VanJS works well for simple enhancements where you need just a touch of reactivity without the framework overhead. I've used it for mini apps, like [raid-calculator](https://github.com/lissy93/raid-calculator). But for anything substantial, you'll spend more time fighting the limitations than building features. It's an interesting experiment in minimalism, but modern frameworks exist for good reasons.
