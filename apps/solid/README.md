<!-- start_usage -->

## Usage

First, follow the [repo setup instructions](https://github.com/lissy93/framework-benchmarks?tab=readme-ov-file#usage). Then `cd apps/solid` and use the following commands:

```bash
npm run dev    # Start dev server (vite)
npm test       # Run tests
npm run lint   # Run lint checks
npm build      # Build for production (vite build)
npm start      # Serve built prod app (from ./dist)
```

For troubleshooting, use `npm run verify` from the root of the project.

## Solid Implementation

<!-- start_framework_specific -->
#### Fine-Grained Reactivity with Signals
The [`weatherStore.js`](https://github.com/Lissy93/framework-benchmarks/blob/main/apps/solid/src/stores/weatherStore.js) uses SolidJS's `createSignal()` for fine-grained reactivity. Unlike React, changes only update specific DOM nodes, not entire component trees.

#### JSX Without Virtual DOM
SolidJS uses JSX syntax but compiles to real DOM operations. No virtual DOM overhead - changes are tracked at the signal level and update the DOM directly.

#### Signal Accessors
Signals return getter/setter pairs: `const [count, setCount] = createSignal(0)`. The store exposes both getter functions and signal accessors for flexible consumption patterns.

#### Race Condition Prevention
The store implements request ID tracking (`latestRequestId`) to prevent race conditions when multiple async operations are in flight simultaneously.

#### Reactive Dependencies
SolidJS automatically tracks dependencies, so reactive computations only re-run when their actual dependencies change, not when the entire component re-renders.

## About Solid
<!-- start_framework_description -->
Solid looks like React on the surface but skips the virtual DOM, updating the DOM directly with fine-grained reactivity. 
This makes it blazing fast and efficient. 
It has a smaller community but a lot of buzz among developers chasing performance. 
If you like React’s syntax but hate its runtime overhead, Solid is refreshing.

<!-- end_framework_description -->

## My Thoughts on Solid
<!-- start_my_thoughts -->
Solid feels like React, but *actually* reactive. It looks like JSX, but underneath it's magic. While React re-renders entire component trees, Solid surgically updates only the exact DOM nodes that need to change. The result is performance that makes other frameworks look sluggish.

The mental shift from React is subtle but profound. Instead of thinking about re-renders and memoization, you think about signals and reactivity. `createSignal` returns a getter and setter - call `temperature()` to read, `setTemperature(25)` to update, and everything that depends on it automatically updates.

Our weather app showcases this, as the temperature display, the weather icon, the styling - they all react independently when the weather data changes. No `useEffect`, no dependency arrays, no `useMemo` - just pure reactive programming that actually works.

The JSX looks familiar, but `<Show>` and `<For>` components replace your typical `{condition && <div>}` patterns. These aren't just syntactic sugar - they're compiled into efficient conditional rendering that only updates when necessary.

`createResource` handles async data elegantly, giving you loading states, error handling, and refetching without the usual ceremony. For our simple weather app, we didn't need Solid's more advanced features like stores or effects, but for something complex, the fine-grained reactivity becomes essential.

## Real-World App
Since the weather app is very simple, it may be helpful to see a more practical implementation of a Solid.js app. So, checkout:
